# BankMachineApplication
This is a project I created as part of the .Net Windows Application Development in C# course I completed at BCIT

The application displays information on 3 bank accounts owned by the user.
The user can deposit, withdraw or transfer funds between the accounts.
When a deposit is made there is a 30 second waiting period before the deposit appears in the account.
Withdrawels and transfers will be processed immediately
